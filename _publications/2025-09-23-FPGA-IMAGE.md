With the proliferation of sophisticated image manipulation techniques, robust and efficient tampering detection has become critically important for multimedia forensics and security applications. Although existing GPU or CPU-based deep learning detection methods are effective, they often rely on cloud services for data transmission, which introduces latency, bandwidth overhead, and privacy vulnerabilities. Edge computing provides a promising solution to this challenge. This paper presents a highly energy-efficient real-time image tampering detection system for edge computing environments. The system achieves significant energy efficiency improvements while maintaining detection accuracy by employing a novel hardware-software co-optimization approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms comparable GPU and CPU implementations by 1.99× and 122.07× in energy efficiency, respectively.
