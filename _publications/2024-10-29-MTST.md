Transformer is pivotal in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling superior performance in language tasks. However, the abundance of parameters poses a challenge for deploying Transformer on resource-constrained edge devices for edge computing, such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). To overcome this limitation, we present an FPGA-based architecture that enables high-performance deployment of Transformer for edge computing, incorporating a unique multitask ping-pong scheme. To strike a balance between computing efficiency and logic resource consumption, we adopt a systolic array as a reusable processing engine (PE), employing meticulous space exploration techniques to determine the optimal quantity and dimensions of PEs within a given resource budget for our architecture. We implement the architecture on ZCU 102 FPGA platform, the experimental results illustrate that the proposed accelerator achieves state-of-the-art performance while consuming fewer resources.
